# yasokoban

Yet Another Sokoban clone

## About

This is a small project I whipped up over the weekend to try out Slick 2D.  Feel free to take a look at the source and make suggestions.

* Arrow keys - to move
* R - to restart the level

## TODOs

* Create the build script
* Add more levels (at least 100)
* Add help menu option

## Thanks
